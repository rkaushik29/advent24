# 🎄 Advent of Code 2024 🎅

**_"25 days, 50 puzzles, infinite learning."_**

Welcome to my **Advent of Code 2024** repository! This is where I'll be solving the festive coding challenges crafted by [Eric Wastl](https://twitter.com/ericwastl). It's a journey of logic, creativity, and sometimes frustration—but always fun! 🎁✨

## 🌟 **About Advent of Code**
[Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/2024) is an annual event featuring a series of daily programming puzzles leading up to Christmas. It’s a fantastic way to:

- 🧠 Sharpen problem-solving skills.
- 📚 Learn new algorithms and data structures.
- 🤝 Collaborate or compete with friends.
- 🎄 Feel the holiday spirit through code!

Each day unlocks two puzzles, and solving them earns you **stars** ⭐. Can you collect all **50 stars**?

## 📂 **Repository Structure**
This repo is organized by day, with solutions for each puzzle:

Each folder `/day{num}` contains:
- **`input.txt`**: The puzzle's unique input.
- **`day{num}.py`**: My Python solution for the day.
- **`README.md`**: Detailed write-ups for each solution (with pseudocode, explanations, and alternative approaches).

## 🛠 **Technologies Used**
- **Language**: Python 🐍
- **Libraries**:
  - `numpy`: For heavy data processing.
  - `matplotlib`: To visualize any graphs or outputs.
  - `pytest`: To ensure solutions are correct with test cases.
  - `qiskit`: For quantum implementations
- **Editor**: Cursor with a cup of hot chocolate ☕!
